# phylineib

The piping way of running this program is
via
neighbor <inp0.stream >out.stream

Ran this and it works. A small complaint about infile
not being avaiable, but otherwise this a way of scripting
use of the neighbor program.

AN minmal example of inp0.stream is included
but if you wanted to use other options then unfortunately ou owuld have
to trun the program interactviely first, making notes of each step
and confecting the input stream file approapriately.

Horrible but phylip is an old program
